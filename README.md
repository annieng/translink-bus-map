# Live Translink Busses

A map live-updating locations of Translink busses in the Greater Vancouver Area (GVRD) built in React/Redux with ['react-map-gl'](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl). Thanks to Translink's [Open API](https://developer.translink.ca/) for bus information.

### Run Locally

Clone or download this repository and run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

Once dependencies are installed run `yarn start` to start project on a local host server.

If you are having trouble seeing the busses, you will need to install the [CORS toggle](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-toggle/jioikioepegflmdnbocfhgmpmopmjkim) from the Chrome Web Store and set it to allow cross-origin sharing.


### Thanks To

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Many thanks to ['react-map-gl'](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl) for providing our mapbox.
